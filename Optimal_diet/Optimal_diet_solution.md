# Optimizing Dietary Choices - README

## Problem Description

This problem involves optimizing dietary choices to meet specific nutritional recommendations while maximizing overall enjoyment of the food and drinks consumed. The task includes:

- Defining a budget constraint.
- Adhering to nutritional recommendations.
- Maximizing satisfaction derived from consuming each food or drink item.

### Input

The input is provided in the following format:

- The first line contains two integers, `n` and `m`, denoting the number of dietary constraints and the total number of available food and drink items.
- The next `n + 1` lines contain coefficients of linear inequalities in standard form `Ax ≤ b`, where `x` represents the vector of quantities of each ingredient, `A` is the `n x m` matrix with coefficients of inequalities, and `b` is the vector with the right-hand side of each inequality.
- Each of the next `n` lines contains `m` integers, describing coefficients of the `A` matrix for each inequality.
- The last line includes `m` integers, representing the satisfaction derived from consuming each food or drink item.

**Constraints:**

- 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 8
- -100 ≤ `Aij` ≤ 100
- -1,000,000 ≤ `bi` ≤ 1,000,000
- -100 ≤ `costi` ≤ 100

### Output

The output format is as follows:

- If there is no feasible diet that satisfies all constraints, output "No solution."
- If you can achieve unlimited pleasure without constraint, output "Infinity."
- If the maximum possible total pleasure is bounded, output two lines:
    1. "Bounded solution"
    2. `m` real numbers, each with at least 15 digits after the decimal point, representing the optimal quantities of each food or drink item.

Please ensure that the output includes at least 15 digits after the decimal point to account for potential computational precision issues, although the evaluation will consider a precision of 10^-3.

## Usage

This problem can be addressed using linear programming techniques. You may choose a suitable programming language or software to implement the solution. Ensure your code handles the input and output formats as described above.

## Example

For a sample input, if a feasible diet exists that satisfies all constraints, your program should output the optimal quantities of food and drink items. If no solution exists, the output should be "No solution."

## Constraints

This problem is constrained by the number of dietary constraints, the number of food and drink items, and the coefficients of inequalities.

## Evaluation

The output of your program will be evaluated based on the correctness of the solution and adherence to the specified output format.

# Optimal Diet Problem Solution - Linear Programming

In this README, I'll describe a solution to the "Optimal Diet Problem," a Python program that aims to optimize dietary choices while adhering to nutritional constraints and maximizing overall satisfaction. 

## Problem Description

The goal of this code is to find an optimal diet that adheres to certain nutritional constraints while maximizing overall satisfaction. The program employs linear programming techniques and explores various combinations of constraints to achieve the best results. 

## Key Algorithms Used

### Gaussian Elimination

The code uses Gaussian elimination to solve linear equations, which is crucial for finding the optimal dietary choices that satisfy constraints.

### Enumeration of Combinations

To find the optimal solution, the program exhaustively enumerates all possible combinations of constraints. This exhaustive search is used to identify the most suitable set of restrictions.

## Input Handling

The program reads input from standard input. The input format includes the number of dietary restrictions (n) and the total number of available food and drink items (mm). It also reads coefficients of inequalities, right-hand side values, and the pleasure values for each item.

## Functions for Linear Programming

The code is structured using several key functions to handle the linear programming aspect:

1. `create_equation(a, b)` creates an equation with a coefficient matrix 'a' and a right-hand side vector 'b'.
2. `find_pivot_element(a, used_rows, used_columns)` is used to find the pivot element, a crucial step in Gaussian elimination.
3. `swap_rows_and_columns(a, b, used_rows, pivot_element)` swaps rows and columns based on the pivot element to prepare for elimination.
4. `update_matrix(a, b, pivot_element)` updates the matrix after selecting a pivot element.
5. `mark_pivot_element_as_used(pivot_element, used_rows, used_columns)` is responsible for marking the pivot element as used.
6. `solve_linear_equation(equation)` solves a linear equation using Gaussian elimination.

## Additional Constraints

The code handles additional constraints, primarily identity constraints, by adding them to the matrix to address inequalities with less than or equal to conditions.

## Optimal Solution Checking

A critical aspect of the program is checking the optimality of the solutions. The code verifies that a solution satisfies all constraints and maximizes the total pleasure. It considers the possibility of both bounded and unbounded solutions.

## Main Optimization Function

The main optimization function, `solve_diet_problem(n, mm, A, b, c, big_number)`, adds identity constraints, iterates through all possible combinations of constraints, and checks if each combination results in an optimal solution.

## Output Handling

Depending on the result of the optimization, the code outputs one of the following:

- "No solution" if no feasible diet satisfies all constraints.
- "Bounded solution" with the optimal quantities of each item if a bounded solution exists.
- "Infinity" if there is an unbounded solution.
